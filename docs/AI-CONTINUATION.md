# AI continuation — SmartDoc production hardening

Resume with: **"Прочети docs/AI-CONTINUATION.md и продължи от next task."**

Read in this order: this file → `docs/session-state.json` → `python tools/tracker/tracker.py show --open --phase <current>`
→ the brief section for the current phase in `docs/implementation-brief.md` (§104 lists the phases).
Branch: `feature/smartdoc-production-hardening`. The tracker is `SmartDoc_Master_Implementation_Tracker.xlsx`
(repository root); update it with `tools/tracker/tracker.py` after every atomic task (see `tools/tracker/README.md`).

## CURRENT STATE

- Phase 0: DONE (commit `4da4ecb`).
- Phase 1 (editor integrity + content preservation):
  - `phase-01a-editor-integrity` (`1fe27a9`, DONE): nested blocks in cells/list items/quotes survive the editor, the
    backend and both exports; list start/format; unknown content stops the save visibly.
  - `phase-01b-fidelity-report`: the Document Fidelity Report (`backend/app/fidelity/`): report model (policy class per
    brief §90), the content check (`compare_words`: "No content changes" only when the source's words and the
    document's are identical), an independent DOCX text reader, every import attaches `Document.importReport`, shown in
    the Проверка panel and the status bar.
  - `phase-01c-export-report`: exports report what they approximate or leave out and re-read the file.
  - `phase-01d-capability-matrix`: `backend/app/capabilities.py` (import/edit/export/round-trip per feature, policy,
    report keys, tests), `GET /api/v1/capabilities`, `tests/test_capabilities.py` ties it to the code both ways.
  - `phase-01e-import-detections` (this commit, FID-002): the import report names everything the importer changes
    without keeping it. `app/fidelity/docx_detect.py` reads the file itself (styles included) for hidden text, caps,
    underline variants, content controls, custom properties/sensitivity labels (never their values), crop/rotation,
    table geometry, bullets in cells, RTL, autolinks, charts/SmartArt, and per-section differences (page setup, odd/even
    breaks, page numbering, page borders, line numbers, vertical alignment). The importer itself notes empty spacing
    paragraphs, links with unsafe addresses (kept as text), empty numbered items, numbered headings, custom and
    multi-level list labels, shapes. Kept now instead of lost: list number format/start/continuation (Element.numbering,
    back into Word and PDF) and the file's core properties (`DocumentMetadata.sourceProperties`, back into Word instead
    of python-docx's "python-docx"/2013 stamps; author/subject into PDF). Bug fixed: section breaks broke the page by
    the ending section's type; Word uses the next section's (continuous breaks became page breaks). The golden JSON
    export is deterministic now (stable ids and times).
- Still open in Phase 1: EDIT-007..012 (attribute-level editor fidelity), TEST-010 consolidation.

## LAST VERIFIED

- 2026-09-27 — import detections: backend 713 passed / 1 skipped; Vitest 84; tsc and eslint clean. Probe confirmed the
  section-break bug before the fix (continuous → page break) and the new test pins Word's behaviour.
- 2026-09-27 — export report: backend 694 passed / 1 skipped; Vitest 84; Playwright 18; tsc and eslint clean.

## WHAT WAS CHANGED

- Backend: `app/fidelity/docx_detect.py` (new), `fidelity/imports.py` (runs it), `parsers/docx.py` (numbering,
  empty-paragraph and section-break handling, source properties), `parsers/docx_inline.py` (`_safe` reports unsafe
  link addresses; OLE wording), `parsers/docx_styles.py` (numbering start/overrides), `models/document.py`
  (`ListNumbering`, `SourceProperties`), `export/docx_export.py` + `pdf_export.py` (numbering formats/start, document
  properties), `capabilities.py` (rows updated: numbering, metadata, custom properties, links, empty paragraphs,
  sections), `scripts/export_golden_json.py` (deterministic).
- Tests: `tests/test_docx_detect.py` (9), `tests/test_docx_numbering.py` (5).
- Frontend: regenerated types; golden JSON regenerated (now stable).

## WHAT PASSED

- Everything above.

## WHAT FAILED

- Nothing open.

## WHAT REMAINS

- Phase 1: EDIT-007 (canonical mark order), EDIT-008 (pasted paragraph/heading alignment), EDIT-009 (pasted picture
  size), EDIT-010 (link title), EDIT-011 (cell alignment/column widths), EDIT-012 (colour/font values outside the
  model reported), TEST-010 consolidation (then the Playwright suite and the phase gate).
- Phase 3 follow-ups recorded on the tasks: DOCX-015 (sections as a model concept), DOCX-016 (multilevel numbering,
  prefixes/suffixes), DOCX-012 (custom properties need DOCX-010), DOCX-026 (autolink off by default).
- Phases 2–18 as listed in the tracker.
- Needs Boril (never guess): Stripe account and prices, e-mail provider credentials, Anthropic API key for real-model
  checks, hosting/deployment target, SEC-021 (sensitivity-label metadata in `корекции.docx` in public history).

## NEXT ACTION

- EDIT-008..011: the editor schema drops pasted `textAlign` on paragraphs/headings, image width/height, link title and
  table cell alignment/column widths (probe via `getSchema(editorExtensions)`). For each: keep the attribute through
  `documentToTiptap.ts` / `tiptapToDocument.ts` where the model has a field, or report it (EDIT-012) where it doesn't;
  a Vitest case per attribute in `frontend/editor/*.test.ts`. Then EDIT-007 (canonical mark order) and TEST-010.

## IMPORTANT WARNINGS

- Never mark a task VERIFIED/DONE without evidence and tests (the tool refuses anyway). DONE also needs the commit.
- The repository is PUBLIC (github.com/Drajeto07/claude). Run the secret scan before every push (it also flags MSIP
  sensitivity labels now; `корекции.docx` is the known hit, SEC-021). Never commit `backend/.env`, the user's
  stress-test DOCX, Office lock files, or any password the user pasted in chat.
- Excel/Word on this machine stamp `MSIP_Label_*` (organisation tenant ID) into Office files on save: the tracker
  tools strip them; scrub any Word fixture before committing.
- Tests must never touch the real Supabase database (`backend/.env` points at it); the test suite enforces this.
- `next build` (and so the E2E web server) type-checks test files too: run `npx tsc --noEmit` before E2E.
- The FastAPI dev server's auto-reload silently does nothing: restart it after backend edits.
- Browser checks: use the throwaway stack (preview configs `smartdoc-backend-throwaway` / `smartdoc-frontend-throwaway`,
  or `tools/dev/throwaway-*.ps1`) — never the `backend` config, which uses the real database. Stop them before E2E
  (same ports 8100/3100). The browser pane may be hidden: `find`/`form_input`/`get_page_text` work, clicks may not.
- Close the tracker in Excel before running `tracker.py` (it refuses to write while `~$` lock files exist).
  `excel_recalc.py` needs a Python with pywin32 (e.g. `%TEMP%\sda\Scripts\python.exe`, the audit venv).
- After changing the importer, regenerate `python -m scripts.export_golden_json` (backend) — the output is stable, so
  the diff shows only real changes.
- The resume reminder is a session-only cron job (hourly at :23, expires after 7 days); it only fires while this session is
  open and idle. Delete it (CronList + CronDelete) when the brief is finished or only Boril-input items remain.
